Implemented as asynchroneous gen_server spawning child to perform operations and
control their returns and deaths.

Rebar used to compile and start node.

To simple compile type:

./make.sh

To run console type:

./run.sh

and then type in erlang console:

etwit_server:follow_revolution().

or

etwit_server:follow(Keyword).

and

etwit_server:get_weirdchina_followers().

or

etwit_server:get_followers(Keyword).

Progress and error reports by default written to /tmp/alogger.log
This behaviour can be changed by editing 'alog' entry in rel/files/sys.config
and regenerating release. The same way can be changed OAUTH keys/tokens.

TODO:

1. Flow control (now routines fails because of twitter restrictions).
2. Not store so long list of numbers in memory, and will not return
  list of 400k+ entries. May be some ETS or RDBMS or KV store.
3. More testing && automatic (unit) tests.
